    <h1>ABOUT UN IN SRI LANKA </h1>
  <ion-card>



  <div class="item item-avatar">
    <p>The United Nations began its work in Sri Lanka in 1952.
      Three years later, on 14 December 1955, Sri Lanka was admitted
       as a member state of the UN.
   For more than sixty years, the UN, in partnership with the government
    and people of Sri Lanka, continues to work to ensure that all Sri Lankan
     people enjoy better living conditions. Collectively and through its 23
     specialised agencies, funds, programmes and offices in Sri Lanka, the UN
     addresses the needs and creates opportunities for the poor, the most
     vulnerable and the young.
The UN has cultivated broad and wide ranging partnerships – with the Government,
 civil society, the broad NGO community, bilateral donors, and international financial
  institutions – to address a multitude of challenges, both in long term development,
  and during times of emergency.
Moving forward, the UN strives to support the Government of Sri Lanka to achieve
sustainable and inclusive economic growth, with equitable access to quality social
services, strengthened human capabilities and reconciliation for long-lasting peace.</p>

      <p>"Sustainable Development Goals are not merely a buzz word in these changing times,
      it is reminder of what our priorities should be. They are a collective agenda for all of us,
      and achieving them is about our collective future, our planet’s future. There is no alternative
      or postponing it for a later day. We must act on it together, and act on it now
