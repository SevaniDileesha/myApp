  <h2>Welcome To SDG Youth Network</h2>
  <p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), otherwise known as the Global Goals, are a universal call
to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), officially known as “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development” is a set of seventeen aspirational “Global Goals” with 169 targets and 244
indicators between them by April 2017. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were born at the
United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro in 2012. SDGs are a set of
universal goals that meet the urgent environmental, political, and economic challenges facing our world.
The SDGs replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which started a global effort in 2000
to tackle the indignity of poverty. The MDGs established measurable, universally agreed objectives for
tackling extreme poverty and hunger, preventing deadly diseases, and expanding primary education to all
children, among other development priorities (United Nations Development Programme, 2017).
Many countries in their development agendas are now focusing on Sustainable Development Goals
and how they will improve lives while protecting the planet over the next fifteen years. By developing
sustainable growth policies, local governments in partnership with the community can improve the quality
of life of citizens and contribute to protecting the global environment.
There are 17 SDGs, and 169 targets and 244 indicators. SDG indicators are classified into three tiers by the
Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG indicators (IAEGSDGs) based on their level of methodological
development and data availability<p>
